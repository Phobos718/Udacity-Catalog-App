## Project 04 - Item Catalog (Book Catalog)

This project is a basic Flask CRUD application, built for Udacity's FullStack Nanodegree, that manages a book catalog in form of a SQL database. The site implements 3rd party authentication.

## Prerequisites

1. Vagrant
2. VirtualBox
3. Python
4. fullstack-nanodegree-vm provided by Udacity

## How to Run

1. Navigate into the vagrant directory and replace the files of the catalog folder with the contents of this zip.
2. vagrant up (inside the vagrant folder)
3. vagrant ssh
4. cd /vagrant/catalog
5. python database_setup.py
6. python dbpop.py (optional - to populate the database with sample data)
7. python application.py

After having completed these steps, the site should be up and running on http://localhost:5000/
